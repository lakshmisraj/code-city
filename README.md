# Code City

**Live:** https://code-city-lakshmi.netlify.app

See a codebase as a 3D city at night. Each file is a building: height is lines of code, width is number of functions, and folders are raised districts. TODO / FIXME comments burn on the rooftops.

- **Play history**: watch the city grow commit by commit, from the first file to today. New files flash and rise, and deleted files are demolished in a cloud of dust.
- **Change heat**: color buildings by how many commits touched them. Hot files are where bugs tend to live and where refactoring pays off.
- **Walk the streets**: WASD to move, mouse to look, Shift to run, Space to jump (you can land on roofs), click to inspect.

## Run it locally

Needs Python 3.8+ and git. No other installs.

    python3 codecity.py serve

Opens http://localhost:8787. Paste any public GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket URL (or `owner/name`, or a local folder path) and press Build. Repos are cloned into `~/.cache/code-city`.

## Export a repo for the hosted site

The hosted site can't clone repos, so export one and drag the JSON onto the page:

    python3 codecity.py export owner/repo              # writes repo.json
    python3 codecity.py export owner/repo --no-source  # smaller, without file previews

Histories longer than 1,500 commits are merged into 1,500 steps, so the timelapse still starts from the first commit. The hosted site bundles Flask and Express in `site/presets/`; type `pallets/flask` or `expressjs/express` to load them.

## Project layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `code-city.html` | The whole app: Three.js scene, treemap layout, timelapse, heat map, walk mode |
| `codecity.py` | Local server, repo exporter (git log → city JSON) and site builder |
| `site/` | What Netlify serves. Rebuild `site/index.html` with `python3 codecity.py build` after editing `code-city.html` |
